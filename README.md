# BlogApp
A fullstack project focused on learning the basics of fullstack web development. This project was made during my Web Programming course in the University of Turku.
The project is built using the MERN-stack (mongo, express, react and node) and works as a Single-page application.
You can log on to the app using a username and the correct password connected to that specific user. 
The App has functions for adding new blogs including the name of the blog, author, and the URL.
The app also has fucntions for liking a specific blog, deleting a blog and ordering the blogs by the amount of likes.
The user information and blog contents are saved onto a MongoDB database. Passwords are encrypted.
